              At <strong>Stock Charity</strong>, we&apos;re reimagining how charitable giving can create long-term impact. 
              Many local and smaller charities struggle with inconsistent funding&mdash;donations often peak during holidays 
              or in response to high-profile events, then quickly taper off. These unpredictable patterns make it difficult 
              for charities to plan ahead or sustain ongoing projects.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              We believe there&apos;s a better way.

              <strong>Stock Charity</strong> is a web-based platform that transforms one-time donations into a lasting 
              source of support. Instead of relying solely on periodic contributions, we invest donated funds into 
              dividend-paying stocks. The dividends generated from these investments are then used to provide consistent, 
              year-round funding to our partner charities.

            <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Our mission is to bring financial stability to the nonprofit sector&mdash;especially the smaller, 
              community-focused organizations that often go unnoticed. By turning donations into investments, we help 
              amplify every contribution and ensure that the causes people care about continue to receive support long 
              after the donation is made.

            <p>
              Investing donations into dividend-paying stocks creates sustainable, long-term value for charities. 
              While it may take several years for dividends to surpass the cost of the stock, once they do, they continue generating consistent incomeâ€”year after year. 
              For example, a $39.83 investment in LyondellBasell in 2014 grew to $92.58 by 2024 and paid out $47.67 in dividends. 
              That&apos;s over 119% of the original donation given back to charity in dividends alone, and the stock itself more than doubled in value. 
              As companies grow, dividends typically increase too&mdash;LyondellBasell&apos;s dividend grew from $0.60 to $1.34 over that decade. 
              By holding stocks for the long term, we aim to generate far more for charities than a one-time donation ever could.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p className="font-bold text-center">
              From the inception of StockCharity, we have accumulated {dividendTotal.toLocaleString('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'CAD' })} in total donations for
              all our partnered charities. We hope that the work we're doing here ends up benefitting our partners for years to come.

          <div className="collapse-content">
            <p>
              Donating through Stock Charity multiplies your impact. Rather than a single-use donation, your contribution is invested to create 
              a steady stream of funding for years to come. Even a modest donation today can result in growing returns that continuously support 
              important causes. For example, a single donation could pay out more than its value over time and continue giving beyond a decade.
              <br /><br />
              Additionally, as a registered charity, Stock Charity can provide official tax receipts, which donors can use to reduce the taxes 
              they owe&mdash;creating another layer of benefit and motivation to give. By combining financial strategy with social impact, 
              Stock Charity ensures that your generosity goes further.
